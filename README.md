## 🎯 The Problem

Other AI coding tools forget your project after one session. You constantly have to re-explain your architecture, past decisions, and code patterns. Your data goes to the cloud, and customization is limited.

## ✨ The Solution: Operator X02

An AI-native IDE where the assistant **truly remembers**. It's the first development environment built with:

*   **🧠 Boundless Memory**: Ask "What did we fix last week?" and the AI recalls the exact conversation, code, and commit—all stored **locally**.
*   **🤖 Multi-Agent Team**: Assign roles: Architect, Developer, Reviewer. They collaborate autonomously to plan, code, and review.
*   **🔒 100% Local & Private**: No account, no telemetry, no cloud. Your code never leaves your machine. Bring your own API key or use local models (Ollama).
*   **🔄 VCS Aware**: Deep integration with Git & SVN. The AI understands your version control state.
*   **📚 Multi-File Autonomous Coding**: AI modifies multiple files at once with a clear visual diff.
*   **🔌 Built for Embedded Dev**: Native support for Arduino, ESP32, STM32 with one-click compile and serial monitor.

## 🖼️ Preview

*(Consider adding a GIF or screenshot here showing the multi-agent panel or the "Boundless Memory" in action, like the auth.ts example from your website)*

> *"Yesterday we fixed the JWT token expiry bug in auth.ts..."* — AI recalls context from a previous session automatically.

## ⚡ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Boundless Memory** | Unlimited, local project history. AI gets smarter with every session. |
| **Multi-Agent Roles** | 8 specialized roles (Architect, Developer, Reviewer, Debugger, etc.). |
| **Provider Calibration** | Fine-tune which AI model (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq) handles which task. |
| **8 Quick Actions** | Select code → Click ⚡ → Explain, Optimize, Refactor, Test, Document, and more. |
| **VCS Integration** | Native Git & SVN awareness. Ask "what changed?" and get real diffs. |
| **Project Analysis** | One-click understanding of your entire codebase structure. |
| **Embedded Support** | Arduino, ESP32, STM32. Compile and monitor from within the IDE. |
| **MISRA C Ready** | Support for safety-critical development workflows. |
| **Full Customization** | Open source (MIT). Fork it, modify prompts, change the UI—everything is yours. |

## 📥 Quick Start (Windows Beta)

1.  **Download**: Get the latest installer (`.exe`) from the **[Releases page](https://github.com/csheng21/operatorX02/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta)**.
2.  **Run**: Execute the `.msi` installer.
3.  **Launch**: Open Operator X02 from your Start Menu.
4.  **Configure AI**:
    *   Bring your own API key (for OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) in Settings.
    *   Or set up a local model via Ollama for 100% offline use.
5.  **Open a Project**: Start coding with your new AI team!

**Requirements**:
*   Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
*   WebView2 Runtime (usually pre-installed)

## 🗺️ Roadmap

*   **February 15, 2026**: Public Beta v1.0.0 (Windows `.exe`) - **YOU ARE HERE** 🎉
*   **March 15, 2026**: Full Source Code Release (MIT License) & production-ready build.
*   **Future**: macOS & Linux support, expanded plugin ecosystem.
