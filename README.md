## 🧠 Boundless Memory — AI That Never Forgets Your Project

Other tools forget after one session. Operator X02 remembers everything — so your AI gets smarter the more you use it.

- **Saves Full Context** — Every conversation, every decision, every bug fix — stored locally and searchable. Ask "why did we change this?" and AI finds the exact conversation from weeks ago. No cloud. No token limits.
- **Better Decisions** — With full project history, AI understands *why* code exists — not just *what* it does. It knows your architecture patterns, past trade-offs, and team conventions.
- **Scales to Big Projects** — Large codebases with hundreds of files need AI that understands the full picture. Operator X02 injects project structure, file relationships, and VCS status — so it never suggests changes that break other parts.

| 172+ Trigger Patterns | ∞ History Depth | ~15ms Search Speed |
